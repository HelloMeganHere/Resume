    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Hello! My name is Megan. I'm learning how to create websites!</p>
    
    <p>It's been a long time since I learned HTML. I first started my HTML journey on Neopets,
      but to pivoted over to photoshop and 3D programs.  I went to school for digital animation, 
      and worked on several projects and even had an internship at DreamWorks' Big Idea, where I 
      worked on Netflix's <i>Veggietales in the house!</i>. <a href="DemoReel.html">(Here is my demo reel if you are interested)</a> 
    </p>
    
    <p>After about a year of freelancing in the animation industry, I found an opportunity through a
      coworker who introduced me to his wife. She got me a job doing maintenance, then I pivoted over
      to data entry. From there I was promoted to an analyst doing inventory management. I ended up 
      working at that company for 8 years. I learned a lot about supply chain, and more importantly myself.
    </p>

    <p>While I was there, I learned about computer languages, specifically, SQL. This opened a flood gate 
        for me, and I became incredily passionate about learning SQL. I still missed my creative side, 
        and I was trying to figure out how I could marry by Supply Chain side with creativity. 
        I learned about PowerBI! This is exactly what I have been looking for. 
    </p>

    <p>I've spent the last year learning PowerBI and the last several months learning Python, HTML, 
    CSS and other development practices. My goal is to one day become a Data Analyst or Business Analyst.
    Or even a web developmer. Or all three!
